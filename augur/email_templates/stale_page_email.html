    ${data['user']} have updated these documents over 6 months ago
    and they haven't been updated since.

    Please do one of the following for each item in your list:

    <ul>
        <li>If it's obsolete and will never update, delete it.</li>
        <li>If it's in the wrong space, move it to the right space</li>
        <li>If it's up to date, valid and organized correctly, simply update the
             page with something like {info}Validated on X/X/XXXX{info}</li>
        <li>If it's archival data that you still want to be searchable then
             add the "ecomm-archived" label to the page</li>
        <li>If it's somewhere between invalid and potentially useful, let
         me know so we can move it to an archive outside of the space</li>
        <li>If it's not up to date but should be made so, please update
         with the right info.</li>
    </ul>
